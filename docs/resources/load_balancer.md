  region            = "per"
  image             = "debian-12"
  size              = "std-min"

}

resource "binarylane_load_balancer" "example" {
  name             = "tf-example-lb"

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The hostname of the load balancer.

### Optional

- `forwarding_rules` (Attributes List) The rules that control which traffic the load balancer will forward to servers in the pool. Leave null to accept a default "HTTP" only forwarding rule. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--forwarding_rules))
- `health_check` (Attributes) The rules that determine which servers are considered 'healthy' and in the server pool for the load balancer. Leave this null to accept appropriate defaults based on the forwarding_rules. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--health_check))
- `region` (String) Leave null to create an anycast load balancer.
- `server_ids` (List of Number) A list of server IDs to assign to this load balancer.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (Number) The ID of the load balancer to fetch.
