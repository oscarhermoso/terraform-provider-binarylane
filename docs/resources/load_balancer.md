# binarylane_load_balancer (Resource)

Provides a BinaryLane Load Balancer resource. This can be used to create, update, and delete load balancers. See [the docs](https://support.binarylane.com.au/support/solutions/articles/1000025661-load-balancer) for more information.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "binarylane_server" "example" {
  count = 2
  # ...
}

resource "binarylane_load_balancer" "example" {
  name             = "tf-example-lb"
  forwarding_rules = [{ entry_protocol = "https" }]
  server_ids = [
    binarylane_server.example.0.id,
    binarylane_server.example.1.id
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The hostname of the load balancer.

### Optional

- `forwarding_rules` (Attributes List) The rules that control which traffic the load balancer will forward to servers in the pool. Leave null to accept a default "HTTP" only forwarding rule. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--forwarding_rules))
- `health_check` (Attributes) The rules that determine which servers are considered 'healthy' and in the server pool for the load balancer. Leave this null to accept appropriate defaults based on the forwarding_rules. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--health_check))
- `region` (String) Leave null to create an anycast load balancer.
- `server_ids` (List of Number) A list of server IDs to assign to this load balancer.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (Number) The ID of the load balancer to fetch.

<a id="nestedatt--forwarding_rules"></a>
### Nested Schema for `forwarding_rules`

Required:

- `entry_protocol` (String) The protocol that traffic must match for the load balancer to forward it. Valid values are "http" and "https".


<a id="nestedatt--health_check"></a>
### Nested Schema for `health_check`

Optional:

- `path` (String) Leave null to accept the default '/' path.
- `protocol` (String) Leave null to accept the default HTTP protocol.

| Value | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| http | The health check will be performed via HTTP. |
| https | The health check will be performed via HTTPS. |
| both | The health check will be performed via both HTTP and HTTPS. Failing a health check on one protocol will remove the server from the pool of servers only for that protocol. |


<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import binarylane_load_balancer.example "<name or id>"
```
