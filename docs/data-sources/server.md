- `image` (String) The slug of the selected operating system.
- `memory` (Number) The amount of memory in MB assigned to the server.
- `name` (String) The hostname of your server, such as vps01.yourcompany.com. If not provided, the server will be created with a random name.

- `port_blocking` (Boolean) Port blocking of outgoing connections for email, SSH and Remote Desktop (TCP ports 22, 25, and 3389) is enabled by default for all new servers. If this is false port blocking will be disabled. Disabling port blocking is only available to reviewed accounts.

- `ssh_keys` (List of Number) This is a list of SSH key ids. If this is null or not provided, any SSH keys that have been marked as default will be deployed (assuming the operating system supports SSH Keys). Submit an empty list to disable deployment of default keys.
- `user_data` (String) If provided this will be used to initialise the new server. This must be left null if the Image does not support UserData, see DistributionInfo.Features for more information.
