## Schema

### Required

- `id` (Number) The ID of the server to fetch.

### Optional

- `backups` (Boolean) If true this will enable two daily backups for the server. `options.daily_backups` will override this value if provided. Setting this to false has no effect.
- `name` (String) The hostname of your server, such as vps01.yourcompany.com. If not provided, the server will be created with a random name.
- `password` (String) If this is provided the specified or default remote user's account password will be set to this value. Only valid if the server supports password change actions (check server.password_change_supported via the servers endpoint). If omitted and the server supports password change actions a random password will be generated and emailed to the account email address.
- `user_data` (String) If provided this will be used to initialise the new server. This must be left null if the Image does not support UserData, see DistributionInfo.Features for more information.

### Read-Only

- `region` (String) The slug of the selected region.
- `size` (String) The slug of the selected size.
